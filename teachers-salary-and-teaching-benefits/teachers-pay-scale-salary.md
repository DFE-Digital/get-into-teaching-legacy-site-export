Teachers’ salaries
==================

When you choose to become a teacher, you’ll be joining a profession that offers a competitive starting salary with plenty of opportunity for career progression. This means you’ll not only be making a difference, but you’ll be rewarded for your contributions with excellent opportunities to climb the career ladder and receive pay rise.

As a newly qualified teacher, you’ll begin on a salary of at least £25,714, or £32,157 in Inner London. As you rise up the pay ranges, you could earn as much as £125,098 as a headteacher, in Inner London.

Schools now have more freedom to develop their own pay policies to attract and retain the teachers that have the greatest impact on their pupils’ learning. So what you’re paid will be linked to performance and not length of service – meaning you can increase your salary faster than ever before.

Additional rewards
------------------

There are other great benefits available including:

*   holidays – you’ll get more days than many people in other professions, though full-time teachers work for 195 days per year in school, and tend to do some work during their holidays
*   a generous pension – when you’re employed as a teacher you’ll automatically become a member of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme
*   special educational needs (SEN) allowance – if you work as a qualified teacher with pupils with SEN, you could be eligible for an SEN allowance of no less than £2,270 and no more than £4,479 per annum
*   teaching and learning responsibility (TLR) payments – additional money if you take on more responsibilities

There are two main ranges for TLR payments – TLR 1 and TLR 2. If you take on sustained extra responsibilities, you could be eligible for a salary uplift within one of these ranges, depending on the category your duties come under:

| TLR 1 max | TLR 1 min | TLR 2 max | TLR 2 min |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| £14,030 | £8,291 | £7,017 | £2,873 |
