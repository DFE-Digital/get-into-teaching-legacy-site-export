Luke Anderson, career changer 
------------------------------

With a Master’s merit in applied translation studies, Luke set out on a career with a language services company. Here he used his language skills to break down language barriers, gaining a reputation for providing an impressive and professional service to his clients – until he decided to use his skills to teach.

“I’ve always enjoyed sharing my knowledge of languages, so teaching was a natural step. Using my language skills was a key to my role, but it didn’t provide opportunities for interaction,” says Luke. “In addition, I decided it wasn’t something I could see myself doing in the long term, as there was no sense of purpose. Teaching, for this reason, has so far provided this in spades!”

To become a qualified teacher, Luke opted for a [school-led route into teaching](/node/2358 "Find out more about school-led teacher training"), which allowed him to be based in a school from the very start of training. This option allows you to have more time to put the theory learnt at a university into practice.

“This style of training is very much a hands-on approach to learning to teach, with the focus on the practicalities in the classroom,” Luke says. “It also helps pupils to accept you as a member of staff from the beginning instead of an outsider part-way through term. I was also supported by a university, which I attended once a week, where we learnt the pedagogy to support classroom experiences.”

A career in teaching not only provides job security, but added benefits of job satisfaction, sustainable income and interaction. In fact, it’s the interaction Luke enjoys about his career change: “Interacting with lots of different people – both children and adults – and the varied work from beginners to advanced level.”

If you’re interested in teaching or feeling unsure, Luke encourages all career changers to call the Get Into Teaching Line. “You’ll be able to access an adviser to assist with your application, with the opportunity to gain observation in a school, see lessons, and talk to teachers. This will help you know if you would actually be able to cope with a group of children!”
