Subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) courses
===========================================

If you've got the right qualities to teach but need to build up or refresh your subject knowledge, you can complete a subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) course.

These courses are usually available if:

*   your degree wasn’t in your chosen subject, but is closely related
*   you studied the subject at A level, but not at degree level 
*   you have an unrelated degree, but relevant professional knowledge in the subject
*   it's been some time since you used your degree knowledge
*   you studied for a languages degree but need a second language at an acceptable level for teaching in schools.

Schools or universities will identify your need for an SKE as part of their selection process, usually at interview. If they feel you need to enhance your knowledge, but have potential to be a great teacher, they'll offer you a teacher training place on the condition that you complete an SKE course.

SKE courses are available in the following subjects:

*   maths (including primary maths)
*   physics
*   chemistry
*   biology
*   computing
*   languages
*   English
*   design and technology
*   religious education

Delivery of SKE courses
-----------------------

SKE courses are usually available all over England at universities, schools, or with other organisations. They can be completed before, or alongside your teacher training and are available to study full-time or part-time, classroom-based or on-line. SKE is typically offered in ITT shortage subjects. The [SKE directory](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subject-knowledge-enhancement-course-directory) sets out what courses are provided.

If you think an SKE course will benefit you, contact the schools or universities you attend to apply to for more information. Alternatively, you can speak to our expert advisers on Freephone 0800 389 2500 or via our [online chat service](https://ta-chat.education.gov.uk/chat/chatstart.aspx?domain=www.education.gov.uk&department=GetIntoTeaching&SID=0) between 8.30am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.
