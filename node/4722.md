Training to teach if you have a disability
==========================================

Teachers with disabilities make valuable contributions both to classrooms and the culture of schools where they work. If you have a disability, don’t be dissuaded from applying to train to teach.

Your rights
-----------

It’s against the law for teacher training providers to discriminate against you because you’re disabled or have special educational needs.

Under the Equality Act 2010, providers must make adjustments to help you do a course or go to an interview, providing your requests are reasonable.

Common reasonable adjustments include:

*   making modifications to buildings
*   offering flexible working hours
*   providing specialist equipment, such as a hearing loop or adapted keyboard

If the help you need is not covered by your provider making reasonable adjustments, you may also be able to get support from [Access to Work](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work). This could include a grant to help cover the costs of practical support in the workplace.

Telling a school or training provider about your disability
-----------------------------------------------------------

It’s up to you if you want to tell your school or training provider about your disability. The main advantage of doing this is to let them put support in place.

Any information you give about your disability is protected under the **[Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act)**. 

Completing a fitness questionnaire
----------------------------------

If you’re offered a place on a teacher training course, you may have to complete a fitness questionnaire before starting. Training providers should only ask relevant questions to make sure you’re able to teach.
