Roger Brown, career changer 
----------------------------

After gaining a 2:1 degree in engineering, Roger initially enjoyed a varied career, as an account manager, freelance cartoonist, and even an Olympic athlete before deciding to teach physics.

Becoming a dad was the turning point for his decision to work with young people: “I realised I was enjoying my afternoon helping out at my daughter’s school more than my job. I also had the gradual realisation how rewarding it is to help others rather than focus on personal gain,” says Roger.

Roger’s engineering degree also provided a natural transition to teaching physics, a subject he regards highly for its clarity and process: “I especially value the way science – especially physics – teaches a clear thought process and a way to make rational sense of the world.”

In addition, Roger finds that teaching physics provides lots of ‘light-bulb’ moments: “I’ve had too many light-bulb moments to mention,” he says. “When I spot the exact barrier stopping a child from learning, I always make sure to think of an analogy to help them through it. With key stage 3 pupils this often involves drama – either getting the children to act out a concept, or sometimes telling them a relevant story. With key stage 4 the breakthroughs are sometimes when you link learning to popular culture.”  

When you train to teach physics, you can benefit from a tax-free bursary. This additional support proved invaluable when Roger decided to retrain: “Bursaries provided a useful income during my teacher training; providing me and my family a layer of security throughout the year.”

On top of the financial incentives, a career in physics offers the job satisfaction of giving all young people the chance to conquer a subject that’s a gateway subject to other careers and employment. 

Many people successfully retrain as teachers every year, and applying for teacher training may be easier than you think. [Register with us](https://register.getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/register "Register with Get Into Teaching") for tailored advice and assistance in beginning your new career.
