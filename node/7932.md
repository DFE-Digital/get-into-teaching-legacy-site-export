Liam turned his passion for geography into an exciting career

With a Royal Geographical Society (and the Institute of British Geographers) scholarship, Liam Ring was able to realise his dream to pursue a career based around his passion for geography.  

“I’ve always been a keen and passionate geographer, and the most inspiring teacher in my school was my geography teacher. They made me see the world differently and allowed me to make links between people and places, which is what geography is all about. After studying geography at GCSE, A Level, and degree level, it made perfect sense to go into a career based around the subject.

I applied for a scholarship with the Royal Geographical Society (and the Institute of British Geographers), financially it was a big help and a massive benefit as it allowed me not to worry about money while training to teach. The extra support also aided my training, which included:

*   support from a network of professionals
*   meeting like-minded geography scholars, which provided a support network during my training
*   access to resources and materials
*   continuous professional development opportunities

If you are thinking about undergoing teacher training, I’d highly recommend it. I can only speak from my personal experience, but it’s completely possible to strike a work life balance, and there is a lot of support out there to get you started on your application process".

> Teaching geography is fantastic, and I couldn’t have hoped for a better placement school and mentor. Learning to teach is exactly like driving, everyone has to learn and develop their driving skills, and it eventually becomes second nature.
