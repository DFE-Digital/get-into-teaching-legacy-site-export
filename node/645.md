​Specialist training options
============================

There are a number of additional training options available if you’re an experienced teacher or finishing a PhD. If you’re a graduate or career changer, you may be eligible to train for a Postgraduate Diploma in Education and Leadership and earn a salary with Teach First. Or if you’re applying for a maths or physics degree, and want to teach after, the Future Teaching Scholars programme can help. Explore this page to find out if you could achieve QTS via a specialist route.
