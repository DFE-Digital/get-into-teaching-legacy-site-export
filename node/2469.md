SKE stories
===========

Subject knowledge enhancement (SKE) courses offer the chance brush up on the subject you want to teach before you start training. You may have studied the subject at A level but not university, for example. These teachers all took advantage of SKE courses, which are available in biology, geography, maths, physics, chemistry, computing, design and technology, and languages.
