Training to teach physical education (PE)
=========================================

PE plays a vital role in promoting physical activities and a healthy lifestyle in a positive and enjoyable way for all pupils. As a PE teacher, you’ll be responsible for honing pupils’ abilities in a range of physical activities and sports – helping them to develop their personal fitness and learn important life skills.

No two days will be the same. Your day-to-day teaching will cover a vast range of activities, including your favourite sports and those in which you personally excel.
