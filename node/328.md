Return to teaching
==================

Expert advice, support and resources are available if you’re considering returning to teaching, or you’re qualified to teach but have never taught in a school.

Thousands of former teachers return to the profession each year, so the transition may be easier than you expect. To make your return to teaching as smooth as possible there’s plenty of support available, which includes the Return to Teaching Adviser service for returning languages, maths or physics teachers, information on available teaching vacancies and helpful resources to prepare you to get back into the classroom. Select an option below to find out more.

Our next return to teaching event takes place on 15 February 2021. Our panel of experts will discuss the different options available to help you return, answering questions on arranging school experience, preparing your application and finding vacancies.
