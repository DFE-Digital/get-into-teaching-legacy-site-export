Part-time courses
=================

Your training will be spread over a longer period, usually over two years. This flexible approach means you can fit training to become a qualified teacher around other commitments, offering a more gradual introduction into the profession. To support your training you could access a [bursary or scholarship](/node/2325), or earn a [salary](/node/2388). 

If you’re interested in training part-time, we recommend contacting the schools or universities directly before applying. You can find part-time courses on the Department for Education’s search tool: [Find Postgraduate Teacher Training](https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses). To find the part-time courses near you, search by either post code, town or city, across England or by school, university or other training provider. Choose the phase and/or subject and change the 'Study Type' to ‘part-time’ (18-24 months).

You could also take the standard approach to training on a one-year teacher training course. Alternatively, you could qualify as a teacher in two terms on an [accelerated course](/node/2344 "Find out about accelerated courses").
