After 20 years as a BBC Producer, Charlotte was ready for a change. She knew she wanted to teach science and work in the public sector, but the idea of a whole new career seemed intimidating. Her teacher training adviser supported her through the switch.

“I had registered an interest with Get Into Teaching, and the call from my teacher training adviser, Simon, really focused my attention into teaching. I probably would not have pursued teaching without this support, as at first the prospect seemed rather daunting.  His advice was invaluable - he was very encouraging right from the start and took me through the process in small, easily manageable steps,” says the now biology trainee.

> Having a friendly, practical advisor responding to questions and emails was so helpful.  He provided unbiased, useful advice at every stage.

“Most importantly, Simon also set me up with great school experience which kick-started my journey into teaching. Once this was completed, it was just a matter of going through the application process and he couldn’t have been more supportive with this.”

“Simon’s help along the way made it so much easier - from advising on referees to proofreading my personal statement. He took a great deal of care and I really felt he wanted me to succeed. I’ve also already recommended the Teacher Training Adviser service to two friends considering maths teaching.”

“Everyone experiences cold feet at some point during the application process, but keep on thinking that you will soon be qualified for a wonderful, fulfilling job. I am very excited and cannot wait to start teaching.”
