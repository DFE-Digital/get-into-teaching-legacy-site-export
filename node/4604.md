Degrees with QTS
================

These courses generally take three to four years full-time, depending on the number and length of your school placements. Some can take two years if you already have undergraduate credits from previous studies.

### There are three types of degrees that lead to qualified teacher status (QTS):

*   Bachelor of Education (BEd) degree - these course are most common for undergraduates hoping to become primary school teachers. Training will concentrate on teaching, learning and related academic principles.
*   Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees - these course are most common for those hoping to become secondary school teachers. Training focuses more intently on giving you specialist knowledge in your chosen subject, but with the onus on enabling you to pass that knowledge on in the classroom.  

Your study will include plenty of time in the classroom learning practical skills from experienced teachers.  Upon graduating, you’ll be recommended for QTS and ready to start your first teaching job right away.

Degrees with opt-in QTS
-----------------------

This new undergraduate route allows students on selected courses to incorporate teacher training partway through their degree course. Successful students will graduate with both a degree in their subject and the recommendation for QTS – [find out more](/node/4605). 

There is plenty of financial support available, including student loans and bursaries of £9,000 in certain subjects – [find out more](/node/2394).

Make sure you’ve established that you’re eligible for an undergraduate teacher training course – providers may also have additional requirements, so it’s worth asking before you apply.

You can apply for undergraduate teacher training through [UCAS](https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/register "Go to UCAS ").
