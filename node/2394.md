Funding for undergraduate teacher training
==========================================

As with any undergraduate degree, you’ll need to pay tuition fees when you study for a degree with qualified teacher status (QTS). However, there’s a range of financial support available to help you along the way.

Student loans
-------------

Home students on a full-time undergraduate teacher training course can apply for the same student loans for tuition fees and maintenance as other students on their first higher education course. [Find out more about undergraduate student loans and how to apply](/node/2395 "Find out about student loans").

Maths and physics undergraduates
--------------------------------

A £9,000 bursary is available to undergraduate trainees on secondary maths and physics courses that lead to qualified teacher status (QTS). This is payable in equal monthly instalments during the final year of the course.

Trainees can also access a £9,000 bursary on an opt-in secondary undergraduate mathematics and physics course that leads to QTS. In this instance, the bursary is payable in the year in which the QTS element of the course takes place.

For both of these courses, trainees taking a four-year undergraduate route that leads to the award of QTS in addition to a Master’s degree receive a £9,000 bursary in both the third and fourth years of their course. You can contact your preferred training provider to find out more about any of these options.

Alternatively, a grant of £15,000 and extra training is available to maths or physics undergraduates training with Future Teaching Scholars – [find out more](https://www.futureteachingscholars.com/ "Find out more on the Future Teaching Scholars website").

Computing undergraduates (opt-in courses only)
----------------------------------------------

Trainees can access a £9,000 bursary on an opt-in secondary undergraduate computing course that leads to QTS. In this instance, the bursary is payable in the year in which the QTS element of the course takes place. Trainees taking a four-year undergraduate route that leads to the award of QTS in addition to a Master’s degree receive a £9,000 bursary in both the third and fourth years of their course.

Modern Foreign Languages (MFL) Undergraduates (Opt-in courses only)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Trainees can access a £9,000 bursary on an opt-in secondary MFL course that leads to QTS. In this instance the bursary is payable in the year in which the QTS element of the course takes place. Trainees taking a four or five year undergraduate route that leads to the award of QTS in addition to a Master’s degree receive a £9,000 bursary in both the third and fourth year or the fourth and five year of their course.

You can contact your [preferred training provider](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/university-led-training/university-led-undergraduate-training/degrees-with-opt-in-qts) to find out more about any of these options.

Eligibility
-----------

Tuition fees and any financial support you receive while training to teach depend on your status as a home, European Economic Area (EEA) or overseas student. Home and EEA students can [find out more at the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies "Find out more about eligibility on the GOV.UK website"), while overseas students can [visit the UKCISA website](http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/Information--Advice/Fees-and-Money/Home-or-Overseas-fees-the-basics "Find out more on the UK Council for International Student Affairs website").
