Tuition Fee and Maintenance Loans
=================================

Overview 
---------

*   a Tuition Fee Loan is available to cover course costs – if you take one out, you don’t have to pay your course costs upfront
*   a Maintenance Loan is available to help with living costs
*   it doesn’t matter if you already have a student loan – you can still apply for both these loans to support your teacher training
*   you will only start making repayments when you earn over the threshold 
*   if you have a student loan already, taking out a further loan for your teacher training will not see your monthly repayments increase

### Tuition Fee Loan

When you start your non-salaried teacher training, you won’t have to pay the cost of tuition fees up front. You can apply for a Tuition Fee Loan to cover the full cost of your course, which is paid directly to your training provider from Student Finance England. Tuition Fee Loans aren't means tested, so regardless of your household income you should be able to claim the full amount for your course fees. 

### Maintenance Loan

*   up to £12,382 [Maintenance Loan](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/new-fulltime-students) for living costs 

All eligible trainees will qualify for at least the minimum loan amount for their living costs, regardless of household income. If you’re on a full-time teacher training course and live in London this will be £5,981. Outside of London it will be £4,289 or £3,410 if you're living at home.

You can use the [student finance calculator](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator) to estimate Tuition Fee and Maintenance Loans and extra funding that may be available, for instance Parents’ Learning Allowance or Childcare Grants. Please note the calculator is for trainees intending to train in 2020/21.

### How to apply

### Loan repayments

Your loan repayments depend on how much you earn – not on how much you have borrowed. 

If you do not already have a student loan, or you took one out on or after 1 September 2012, you are only required to make repayments when you are earning over £26,575. Your repayments will not increase if you take out a loan for teacher training.

If you took out a student loan before 1 September 2012, you are only required to make repayments when you are earning over £19,390. Your repayments will not increase if you take out a loan for teacher training.

The table below shows your monthly repayments if you've no previous student loan or if you have a loan taken out from 2012 or later. If you have a student loan from before 2012, your monthly repayments will be different from the below.
