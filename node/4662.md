Your training will focus on ensuring that you have the right skills and abilities to teach effectively. To achieve this, you’ll receive an abundance of help from a dedicated team, which will include subject mentors and tutors who are there to ensure you successfully complete your teacher training year. Zoe Levin, current trainee with The Compton School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT), explains the support available on your teacher training year. 

“I’m on a course led by a school. At the start, you’ll spend time observing other teachers and then gradually increase the number of hours you teach throughout the academic year. By the end of school year, you should almost be teaching a full timetable. With the extra teaching hours and experience you gain, it really sets you up well for becoming an effective teacher and successfully completing your newly qualified teaching year.”

“The structure of the course, and the support available, really ensures you progress and develop as a teacher. You’ll always have experience in at least two schools and at each school you’ll have a mentor who will discuss your development, and any other concerns that you may have with your teaching. My mentor has always been available at any given time for help and support. Alongside this, a dedicated team is available if you need extra support.”

“Once a week, we have an academic day where teaching standards are discussed and key aspects of teaching are developed through seminars, research and courses. Additionally, having the ability to be able to discuss your teaching practise with other trainees is a very valuable resource to have.”

> The fact that the course is primarily teaching based provides you with so much classroom time that behaviour management develops over time - the more time spent teaching the better. Seminars also provide a number of different techniques that help you develop your behaviour management techniques - for me the best way to develop this was by teaching!

There’s no better time to start teacher training, you’ll also be financially supported – you could receive a bursary while you train as a teacher. There’s even support before you apply with our free Teacher Training Adviser service, when your register with [Get Into Teaching](/node/2278).
