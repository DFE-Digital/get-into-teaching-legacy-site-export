Hasina Nizamee
--------------

With a 2:1 degree in biology and health and safety management, Hasina initially pursued a career as a health and safety adviser. But realising this wasn’t allowing her to use her knowledge of biology, Hasina decided she wanted to work with young people and really make a difference – and teaching was the ideal profession for her.

Hasina chose a teacher training course led by a school, and is training at the Arthur Terry National Teaching School. Teacher training, she says, has its ups and downs, but is quick to add that it’s all worth it. “When you get through to a child, when you see their eyes light up with curiosity and wonder, you remember what brought you into teaching.”

To help Hasina along the way, she received a generous training bursary that has supported her throughout the duration of the course. As part of the application process, Hasina had to demonstrate her potential as a teacher. “I had to teach some year 7 students, and that was the best part of the interview!” Her advice to others is to prepare well in advance and to plan your lesson in as much detail as you can – but most importantly, “be yourself.”

Making the move into teaching is a decision Hasina is glad to have made. “Teacher training has been by far one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life”, she says. “It has made me realise my potential, testing the limits of my patience, confidence, organisational skills and empathy, as well as academic ability.”
