Laura Hurn
----------

Laura has been a business studies teacher for eight years. She went into teaching following a career in industry. While she enjoyed her previous job in the retail sector, Laura felt compelled to do more – and it was this feeling that inspired her to teach. “I loved the excitement of retail, but the chance to educate children to become whatever they want to be was just really appealing. Being able to make a difference to individuals’ lives, rather than being motivated by pounds in tills, is really satisfying.”

Business studies is just as important as the core subjects, Laura says, because it equips students with the necessary skills for a future in any kind of job. And with such a wide variety of business-based university courses and careers available, the importance of teaching business studies at school is greater than ever before. “As a business studies teacher, you’ve got the flexibility to ensure that the curriculum matches the needs of the students.”

With the skills gained from studying the subject, Laura has seen some of her pupils go on to specialise in finance, human resources, and marketing. But her proudest moments as a teacher come from when she has helped students overcome challenges. “One particular student I taught really struggled, but we worked together and I supported him, and he ended up securing a B. When your students achieve something, that’s when teaching is so rewarding.”

But the rewards of teaching business studies don’t stop there. It’s a subject that lets young people see where they could be in the future – and it’s up to the teachers to make sure that the paths to get there are clearly laid out. “You find that a lot of students are already interested in business, so it’s just about putting the other pieces of the jigsaw in around that.”
