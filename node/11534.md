Career progression
------------------

If you want to [progress in your career](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/life-as-a-teacher/real-life-experiences/career-progression-stories) back in England, you may wish to apply for a National Professional Qualification.

A [National Professional Qualification](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-list-of-providers) can help you get into leadership positions such as head of department, deputy headteacher or headteacher.

You can find out more about reformed suite of National Professional Qualifications, which will be [available from September 2021, here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms).

How we’re improving things for teachers
---------------------------------------

A lot has changed for teachers in England over the last few years. The Department for Education is working with schools to:

**1\. Reduce workload**

Teachers, middle leaders and senior leaders reported working [5 hours less per week than they did in 2016](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/838433/Teacher_workload_survey_2019_brief.pdf).

Take a look at [what we’re doing to reduce workload](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/reducing-school-workload#department-for-education-policy), including our [workload reduction toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reducing-workload-in-your-school).

**2\. Improve behaviour**

We’ve [invested £10m through Behaviour Hubs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/behaviour-hubs) so that schools with exemplary behaviour can work closely with schools that want to improve behaviour.

**3\. Make it easier for teachers to work flexibly**

Take a look at our [flexible working resources for schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/flexible-working-resources-for-teachers-and-schools).

You can [search for jobs with flexible working patterns on Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/).

Getting qualified
-----------------

If you taught overseas as an unqualified teacher, you’ll need qualified teacher status (QTS) to teach in a maintained school in England.

[If you’re experienced and have a degree, you may be able to get QTS through the assessment only route](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/specialist-training-options/assessment-only) without any further training. 

[If you have less than 2 years of teaching experience, you can get qualified on an initial teacher training course](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/postgraduate-teacher-training-courses/teacher-training-courses). 

[If you qualified overseas in the EEA, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA, you can apply for QTS](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts#teachers-qualified-in-australia-canada-new-zealand-and-the-usa).

You can teach as an unqualified teacher in academies and free schools.
