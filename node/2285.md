In detail 
----------

### Degree requirement (or equivalent qualification) 

You need to have a degree (or equivalent qualification) to train on a postgraduate initial teacher training course. For equivalent qualifications, you’ll need to confirm your qualification is equivalent to a degree. If you don’t have a degree (or equivalent qualification), you can train on a [university-led undergraduate course](/node/2379) and graduate with qualified teacher status (QTS). There’s also the opportunity to work as a [further education teacher](/node/332), whether or not you already have a degree. 

### GCSEs or their standard equivalent

You’ll need to demonstrate GCSE grade C / 4 (or standard equivalent) in maths and English - and a science subject for primary trainees. If you don’t meet this entry criteria, your training provider may ask you to sit a GCSE,  equivalency test, or offer other evidence to demonstrate your ability.

### Overseas qualifications 

If all or part of your qualifications are from outside the UK, you should contact the schools or universities you would like to train with, as they make the final decision if your qualifications meet the minimum requirements -  you may be asked to formally recognise any overseas qualifications through [UK NARIC](https://www.naric.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx). We can help you with this. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 and we can provide you with:

*   guidance on your equivalent qualifications 
*   a free UK NARIC statement of comparability (this usually costs £49.50 plus VAT) once you’ve submitted your application, if required by your provider
