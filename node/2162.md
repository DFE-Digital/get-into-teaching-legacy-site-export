School and university events
============================

The schools and universities that run teacher training courses often hold their own events. These give you a valuable opportunity to get a feel for what different teacher training courses might be like. Each event is different, but typically they’ll cover areas such as course information, application advice, school experience and the chance to talk to current trainees or staff.
