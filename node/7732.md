Bursaries and scholarships
==========================

There are three types of funding available for teacher training - depending on your circumstances, you could receive all three:

1\. Tax-free bursary or scholarship  
  
2\. Tuition Fee Loan and Maintenance Loan  
  
3\. Additional financial support if you’re a parent, have an adult dependent or have a disability

Further information on tuition fee and maintenance loans and additional financial support can be found on the [funding my training page](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-my-teacher-training). Alternatively, you could earn a [salary while you train](/node/2388). Information on undergraduate bursaries can be found on the [funding for undergraduate teacher training page](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/university-led-training/university-led-undergraduate-training/funding-for-undergraduate-teacher-training).

1.  Bursaries and scholarships are available to trainees on a tuition fee-based teacher training course in England that leads to the award of qualified teacher status. Availability is dependent on your highest relevant academic award and the subject in which you are training to teach. To receive a bursary or scholarship you must be entitled to support under the Student Finance England criteria. Residents of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will need to be entitled for support as set out by your country’s student finance body (Student Finance Wales, Student Awards Agency Scotland or Student Finance NI). Both elements will be assessed by your teacher training provider. Candidates with overseas degrees may be asked to formally recognise any overseas qualifications through UK NARIC. We can help you with this. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 and we can provide you with guidance on your equivalent qualifications and a free UK NARIC statement of comparability (this usually costs £49.50 plus VAT) once you’ve submitted your application to teacher training, if required by your training provider. 
2.  Bursaries are available to trainees with a first, 2:1, 2:2, Master’s or PhD.
3.  Trainees in chemistry, computing, maths and physics are able to apply for a teacher training scholarship with the appropriate professional body. Scholarships are awarded in place of a bursary. Each of the professional scholarship bodies sets its own eligibility criteria - find out more on the dedicated [scholarship pages](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview/scholarships). Scholarships are awarded in place of a bursary.
