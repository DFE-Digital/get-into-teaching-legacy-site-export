What you need to know
---------------------

As a maths specialist it’ll be your responsibility to act as an authority on the subject within your school, influencing how high-quality maths teaching is delivered in all classes. This also includes training to deliver quality teaching across the diverse primary curriculum – from science to the arts, history, geography, and basic computing skills.

Through your teacher training, you’ll develop the skills to become an expert in teaching maths to children between the primary ages of 5 and 11. You’ll take a lead in inspiring them to overcome barriers, solve problems, and elevate their enthusiasm for the subject. Teaching maths as a specialist has never been more important:

*   you’ll ensure every child gets the chance to leave primary school and begin secondary education with the best opportunity to succeed
*   you'll increase essential maths skills needed for everyday life
