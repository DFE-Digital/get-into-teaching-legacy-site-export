Funding for training to teach biology
=====================================

If you’re interested in training to teach biology, you could be eligible for a £7,000 tax-free training bursary – or receive a salary while you train. There are three types of funding available to teach biology if you’re on a non-salaried teacher training course. Depending on your circumstances, you could receive all three. 

1\. Tax-free bursaries
----------------------

As a trainee biology teacher, you could be eligible for a £7,000 bursary if you have a first, 2:1, 2:2, Master’s or PhD.

Once you know if you’ll be receiving a bursary, you can find out how and when you will receive your funding on our [how you will be paid](/node/2396) page.

2\. Tuition Fee Loan and Maintenance Loan
-----------------------------------------

With or without a bursary, you can also access a [Tuition Fee Loan to cover your tuition fees and a Maintenance Loan for your living costs](/node/2410). The available loans are:

*   a Tuition Fee Loan of up to £9,250 to cover your fees
*   a Maintenance Loan of up to £12,010 to support your living costs

3\. Additional financial support
--------------------------------

If you have children or a disability, extra funding is available. For instance, you could get:

*   85% of childcare costs up to £174.22 a week (1 child) or up to £298.69 a week (2 or more children) [Childcare Grant](https://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant)
*   up to £1,766 per year [Parents’ Learning Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/parents-learning-allowance)
*   [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit)
*   [Disabled Students’ Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas)
*   up to £3,094 per year [Adult Dependants' Grant](https://www.gov.uk/adult-dependants-grant)
