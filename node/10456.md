Chloe's story

"I thoroughly enjoyed my teacher training. The school welcomed me in as another member of staff and you really do feel like part of the team. You are given opportunities to be involved in other areas of school life outside the classroom, from sporting events to parents' evenings, which really helps you gain an understanding of the varied role of a teacher."
