Colette's story
---------------

"I have never felt that I fit in anywhere quite as much as I did on my teacher training course and I will be forever thankful for that. I threw myself into my work and my students, and their learning was my number one priority. I was able to feel like a real teacher from day one - no one treated me like a trainee or a student."
