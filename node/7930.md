A passion for chemistry and working with students made teaching the perfect fit

After graduating, Saira jumped straight into training as a teacher. Having gained experience through providing support to local students, and with a love of chemistry, the decision to train to teach was easy.

“I decided teaching was a career for me after becoming involved in my university’s outreach STEM summer school, set up for gifted and talented students from poor socio-economic boroughs. It was through this experience that I truly appreciated the significant role teaching has in raising pupil’s aspirations, motivations and dreams. I also saw how I can make a difference in someone’s life; this provided a great opportunity to give back to the community by passing on my passion for chemistry

Alongside my UCAS Teacher Training application, I successfully applied for the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) scholarship. The scholarship not only awarded £28,000 tax-free, it also provided the opportunity to undertake professional development courses at the National STEM Learning Centre in York. These courses, alongside my teacher training, increased my professional development as well as my teaching practice. One of the other highlights was networking with other scholars – where I made new friends and we shared our experiences. I would definitely recommend applying for a scholarship, not only the financial support, but also the added guidance that supported my teacher training.”

> Now that I’m training - being up in front of the class truly puts me in my element and I can feel my passion for chemistry come to life when I’m teaching. It only takes one student to say ‘Miss I really enjoyed that lesson’ that makes the profession worthwhile.
