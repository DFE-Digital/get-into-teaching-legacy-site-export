Event information:

This online meeting is designed to enable you to meet members of our team, including the Head of our Teaching School, and ask as many questions has you like. It is an informal session where you can ask anything, such as: course requirements, what it takes to become a teacher, routes into teaching, fees, what the course looks like, SKEs, funding, qualifications, salary expectations, career progression, etc. No question is too small or too silly!
