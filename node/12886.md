Event information:
------------------

This free online webinar aims to help you discover how you can use your passion to inspire others. Imagine a job where you are able to use your knowledge of Modern Foreign Languages every day and one where you can play a crucial role in instilling a love of languages in the next generation - perhaps even in shaping the next Linguist, Translator or Teacher! Immersed in your subject you will make new discoveries and develop a deeper understanding of Languages; working with like-minded individuals and expressing your subject in new ways.

Hear from MFL Teacher and i2i Subject Tutor Morgane Laurens and discover what being a MFL Teacher is really like. The webinar will look at:

*   what the curriculum covers at KS3 and KS4
*   what a typical working week may look like
*   the rewards, challenges and realities of teaching Languages
*   what you can do to develop your subject knowledge ahead of starting a programme (to include Subject Knowledge Enhancement courses in your second language)
*   how the i2i Subject Studies programme supports you in becoming an MFL teacher (most MFL teachers will teach a second language)

You will also have the opportunity to ask questions and find out more about how the i2i Teaching Partnership can support you into your teaching career.
