Graduating into a rewarding computing career

Sophie Clark, a current British Computing Society (BCS) scholar, speaks passionately about the scholarship scheme and the masses of confidence she’s gained from teacher training.

“Before I jump into my experience of teaching, I would first like to tell you how I got here. When choosing my GCSE options I was instantly drawn to computing because of the creativity and possibility it brings to a wide range of areas. Following on from school, I continued the subject at A level and university. I have now entered the world of teaching - where student lie-ins and daytime TV are a thing of the past.

I was initially drawn to teaching as a career because I liked the idea of making a difference to society by encouraging the young minds of the future. Computing can sometimes be perceived as dull or boring. However, this current age, I believe computing is a really important subject for ALL of us to learn!

The support from my training team and cohort was phenomenal, with everyone cheering you on and wanting you to do your best. You’re given multiple support figures; including your training leader, professional mentor, personal mentor and subject mentor. As well as this, you’re given a mass of materials to build upon and learn from during your training year.

I would classify myself as a bit of an introvert, but I’ve seen a positive change in myself. I’ve become more independent, more confident and now view myself as a professional with a rewarding role in society.

The rewards from the BCS Computing Scholarship have been amazing. I received masses of resources including the latest books, magazines and media. Through my BCS membership, I’ve also  been invited to member-only webinars, workshops and training days".

> I urge all budding computing teachers to apply for a scholarship! By being a BCS computing scholar, it really puts you one-step ahead of the game and makes what is likely to be a challenging year much more reassuring.
