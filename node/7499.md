Teacher training courses
========================

Postgraduate teacher training courses are available across England, led by universities or schools. The course you choose will depend on your subject, degree class and location. Whichever course you choose, your training will largely be the same. If you don't have a degree, you can gain a degree and qualified teacher status (QTS) together on an [undergraduate course](/node/2379). 

All teacher training courses will offer
---------------------------------------

*   qualified teacher status (QTS), which is needed to teach as a qualified teacher in England
*   plenty of classroom experience in at least two schools – a minimum of 24 weeks of school experience 
*   training to meet the [Teachers’ Standards](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/how-to-apply/prepare/helpful-information-and-resources), which will include classroom management and making your subject accessible to your pupils 
*   expert academic and practical guidance from mentors and tutors who are there to help you succeed 

Most courses will also offer a [postgraduate qualification](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/pgce), usually a Postgraduate Certificate in Education - speak to your chosen course provider(s) to find out what qualification their course offers. 

Funding your teacher training
-----------------------------

*   you could receive a tax-free [£26,000 bursary to train](/node/2325), depending on your subject and degree class
*   [Tuition Fee and Maintenance Loans](/node/6585), irrespective of whether you received these loans during your undergraduate degree
