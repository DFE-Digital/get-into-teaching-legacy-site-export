Teachers' Pension Scheme
========================

When you start teaching, you’ll not only receive a competitive salary and plenty of opportunity for career progression - you’ll also be automatically enrolled with the Teachers’ Pension Scheme.

The Teachers’ Pension Scheme is a generous state backed public pension, providing you with a regular source of income when you retire.

The benefits:
-------------

*   you’ll receive a guaranteed pension through the Teachers’ Pension Scheme
*   it’s based on your salary and service rather than investments, so there’ll be no surprises when you come to claim your pension
*   it will provide you with a regular source of income when you retire, increasing each year in line with the consumer prices index to keep pace with inflation - the scheme is flexible and even allows you to take some of it as a tax-free lump sum if you prefer
*   offers insurance like protection for you and your family in the event of you becoming too ill to teach or your premature death
