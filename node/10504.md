Mandy's story   
----------------

![](/sites/default/files/Mandy%20Langan%20image.jpg)**Mandy, teacher**  
  
"I decided I needed a complete career change from my banking role and train as a teacher. I have always wanted to teach as I enjoyed every minute of my own schooling and I fondly remember the teachers who supported me. They instilled a sense of self-belief and were relentless in their encouragement. The course was very much a tailor-made approach. The constant support and encouragement from my tutors and mentors was invaluable."
