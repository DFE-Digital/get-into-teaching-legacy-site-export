Preparing for teacher training
==============================

The key to a successful application is effective preparation. This short summary will give you an idea of the things you can do to get prepared before you apply. If you’re ready to apply, there are also some handy steps to take before submitting your application.

Get one-to-one support from our teaching experts

Our teacher training advisers are all experienced teachers ready to support your journey into teaching – they’ll just be a phone call, text or email away. Please get in touch, between 8am and 8pm Monday to Friday, on 0800 389 2500 to be allocated your very own personalised adviser.

Arrange school experience - we can help with this

School experience will provide you with valuable insight into teaching. It could also strengthen your application and prepare you for potential interviews. [We can help you find school experience](https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/). 

Attend a teacher training event

Events offer the perfect opportunity to find out more about teacher training. You can have any questions or concerns on topics such as funding and the support available while competing teacher training answered by people who’ve been through the process. [Find an event near you](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teaching-events).

Register with UCAS Teacher Training

Sign up with UCAS Teacher Training, so you’re kept up to date with important information and updates. You'll be able to make a start on some parts of the application such as your personal details and work experience, and you can complete the rest once you’re ready to submit your application. [Go to UCAS to register](https://2020.teachertraining.apply.ucas.com/apply/student/login.do).

Applying for teacher training
-----------------------------

Find teacher training courses

[Search postgraduate teacher training courses in England with the Department for Education’s search service](https://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/). You can search by location, training provider and subject. When you apply, you have three choices for teacher training providers. It’s a good idea to select three choices; the more flexible you are, the more likely it is that you’ll secure a place.

Write your personal statement

The personal statement is your chance to make your application stand out by discussing your experience, knowledge and skills, and demonstrating how they’re transferable to the classroom. [Read our advice on how to make yourself stand out](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/preparing-your-teacher-training-personal-statement).

Arrange your references

Your referees can tell training providers about your qualities and abilities, so it’s important they know you well. [Find out more about the requirements for references](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/how-to-apply-for-teacher-training/arranging-your-teacher-training-references). 

Complete and submit your application

Once you're ready to apply, you’ll need to submit your application via UCAS Teacher Training. Make sure you familiarise yourself with the deadlines to allow yourself plenty of time. [Go to UCAS Teacher Training to make a start](https://2020.teachertraining.apply.ucas.com/apply/student/login.do).
