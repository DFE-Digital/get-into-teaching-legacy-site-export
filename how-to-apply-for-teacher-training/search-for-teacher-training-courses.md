Search for postgraduate teacher training courses
================================================

Find the right teacher training course for you by using the Department for Education’s Find postgraduate teacher training service. The service lists every course available in England and you’ll be able to filter the results by location, training provider and subject.

When you’re ready to apply, you’ll need to determine the correct codes for your training providers and the subject(s) you want to teach – these can all be found using the DFE’s search tool. These are:

*   Training provider code 
*   Training programme code

Once you know the codes for each provider, you'll need to include these in the choices section of your application form.

### Tips on choosing the right course

**Do your research -** once you have an idea of the courses available, you can start researching individual providers in more detail via their websites or by attending a teacher training event. 

You can also find out more about individual schools using [Ofsted’s inspection reports](http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/), compare and contrast official university undergraduate teacher training course data at [Unistats.com](https://discoveruni.gov.uk/), and get greater insight into completion and employability rates from different training providers in the [initial teacher training performance profiles report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/initial-teacher-training-performance-profiles-2016-to-2017).

**Use your school experience -** [gaining school experience](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/school-experience) will help you develop a better understanding of the different options that are available, and the teachers you meet may be able to tell you about other training providers in your area.

Remember, if you need to commute or relocate to be able to undertake your training, it’s important to consider the logistical and financial implications. For example:

*   the cost of public transport and length of commute; do you know where your chosen providers’ placement schools are?
*   what are your accommodation options if you need to relocate, and are they within your budget?
