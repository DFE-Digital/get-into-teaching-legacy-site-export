An overview of the teacher training application form
====================================================

When you’re ready to apply, you apply via UCAS Teacher Training. Here we’ve provided some high-level information on the six sections of the application form, with tips on how you should approach each one. There’s no pressure to complete your application all in one go. You can save your progress and continue at any time. A key part of the application form is your personal statement. This is your opportunity to share why you have chosen a career in teaching and why you would make an excellent teacher.

1\. Personal details
--------------------

Some of these fields will already be populated from when you registered with UCAS Teacher Training. There’ll be some extra fields to confirm, such as your address, email, nationality and disability. 

2\. Choices
-----------

You can apply to at least three teacher training course providers – use all three for a greater chance of success. You should use the [Department for Education's find tool](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses-in-england) to determine the correct codes for your training providers and the subject you want to teach. You will need:

*   Training provider code 
*   Training programme code
*   Training location campus code 

Once you know the codes for each provider, you'll need to include these in the choices section of the application form. [Read our guide on choosing a teacher training provider](/node/8452). The last fields in this section are declaring any criminal convictions and providing any dates when you may not be available for interviews.

3\. Education
-------------

You’ll have the opportunity to add the schools, colleges and universities you attended and any qualifications gained – they’ll be split into four parts;

*   Schools/colleges/universities attended
*   Confirmation of your GCSE qualifications
*   A level results
*   Degree type and qualifications and credits from your degree

When completing your application, you’ll need to have your certificates – or details of your certificates - with you, as you'll need to know pass dates and examining boards where appropriate. If you’re unable to identify your examining board, you could select ‘other’ until you have the relevant paperwork. If all or part of your qualifications were gained abroad, you might need a NARIC check to determine equivalency to the UK standard. If you’re yet to retake a GCSE, there’s a ‘pending’ option, or a check box if your provider accepts equivalency tests.

4\. School and work experience
------------------------------

Here, you’ll need to provide details of your school experience and work history, including dates, any periods spent abroad and your current occupation. This can include work placements and observations, as well as paid and unpaid work. The word count is limited to 500 characters per experience, so it might be helpful to opt for bullet points focusing on your main skills, tasks and responsibilities.

5\. Personal statement
----------------------

This is your chance to ensure your application stands out. The word count is tight; you’ll have 4,000 characters over 46 lines, so ensure you show off your knowledge and skills in relation to teaching. Read our tips on preparing a  [successful personal statement](/node/616).

6\. References
--------------

You’ll need to provide two references - contacting your referees and submitting the completed references will need to be done via UCAS. This can only be done once all the sections above are completed. A handy tip is to let them know in advance they've been chosen, as you can't submit your application for consideration until you receive both references. Find out more on the [process and requirements of referees](/node/2407). 

Once you've received your references you'll be able to pay and submit your application. When you apply the UCAS application fee will be £1.
