<img alt="Case Study Image" src="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Fiona%20%20-%20s94.jpg"></img>

After graduating from university and spending time living in Mexico, Fiona was eager to return to her passion: languages. By using her language skills, she was able to make the move into teaching. With regular support from her teacher training adviser, her goal to make a difference and do something she enjoyed became a reality.

“I always loved languages having studied French and German at A level and had recently spent three years living in a Spanish-speaking country. With my knowledge and experience, I decided this was what I wanted to teach at secondary level,” says Fiona. 

“Without the help of my personalised adviser, Leilah, I wouldn’t have completed my application. Leilah, was extremely helpful as she understood the application process from both my perspective and that of the teacher training provider. My weekly chats with my adviser ensured I also remained focused and kept my application on track.”

“Initially, it felt like a complicated process, but my adviser explained everything really clearly. And importantly offered in-depth support on writing my personal statement, and how to sell yourself. Without her I would have become frustrated and given up!”
