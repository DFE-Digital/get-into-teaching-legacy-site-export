EU nationals
============

Teaching in England offers a wealth of opportunities and rewards to enable you to build a stimulating and successful career. Additionally, during your teacher training year you could get a tax-free bursary, and a tuition fee loan from Student Finance England. Under current rules, EU nationals can access this support if you've resided in the European Economic Area or Switzerland throughout the three-year period before the start of the course. 

Read our short summary, below, on preparing for teacher training. Remember to [register with us](/node/2278) for support throughout your application to teacher training. You could even get your own personalised adviser, through our free [Teacher Training Adviser service](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/get-help-and-support/premier-plus), to support you throughout your journey into teaching. 

Check your qualifications 
--------------------------

The minimum requirements for teacher training in England are that you hold a degree and high school qualifications in maths and English (and science, for primary trainees only), which should be UK equivalent to a GCSE grade C / 4.

If all or part of your qualifications are from outside the UK you should contact the schools or universities you would like to train with, as they make the final decision if your qualifications meet the minimum requirements -  you may be asked to formally recognise any overseas qualifications through [UK NARIC](https://www.naric.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx "Go to NARIC website "). We can help you with this. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 and we can provide you with:

*   guidance on your equivalent qualifications 
*   a free UK NARIC statement of comparability (this usually costs £49.50 plus VAT) once you’ve submitted your application, if required by your provider
    

Financial support during your training 
---------------------------------------

EU nationals starting teacher training courses in the academic years 2019/20 and 2020/21 will still be eligible for a tax-free bursary or scholarship and a tuition fee loan. Under current rules, EU nationals can access this support if they have resided in the European Economic Area or Switzerland throughout the three-year period before the start of the course. [Find out more](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/eu-student-funding-continued-for-202021). 

*   you could get a [tax-free bursary](/node/2325)
*   through Student Finance England, you may be able to receive a [tuition fee and maintenance loan](/node/2410) 

The financial support from a bursary will depend on your degree classification and your nationality or residency status. Contact us on 0800 389 2500 for guidance on your equivalent qualifications.

Explore your teacher training options
-------------------------------------

You should start [exploring the different training courses](/node/7498) available to get an idea of which one may suit you. 

When you apply, you have three choices for teacher training providers. It’s a good idea to use all three choices; the more flexible your are, the more likely it is that you’ll secure a place.

School experience 
------------------

Getting some classroom experience can help you to decide whether teaching is right for you - it could also strengthen your application. We can help you gain your [school experience](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/school-experience "Go to School Experience page "). 

Increase your subject confidence 
---------------------------------

Once accepted on a training course, you could access help to refresh your subject knowledge or teach another related-subject via a funded [subject knowledge enhancement course](/node/2339). 

Apply 
------

UCAS Teacher Training is the application service for teacher training, and you use their website to apply, when ready - [read our tips on applying for teacher training](/node/2557). 

After you qualify as a teacher you’ll be in demand, particularly if you train to teach [languages](/node/2314), [computing](/node/2319), [physics](/node/2322), [maths](/node/2328), [biology](/node/2312), [geography](/node/2310) or [chemistry](/node/2317). Remember to [register with us](/node/2278), you could receive support throughout the application stages with your own personal adviser.
