Application process: Apply 1 and 2
----------------------------------

When you first apply, you’ll be in the Apply 1 phase, which allows you to apply to three training providers. For each option, you can select any subject, training provider or age group. Once you’ve submitted your choices, you can only change them once within seven days of submitting your application.

Providers will have up to 40 working days to let you know their decision. UCAS is closed between 24 December and 1 January (inclusive) - these dates do not count as working days.

If a provider offers you a place following your interview, you’ll have 10 working days to let them know if you accept the offer. You can do this via the UCAS website – UCAS will get in touch with the provider to let them know your decision.

If you’re not offered an interview by any of your Apply 1 choices, or you choose not to accept an offer, then don’t worry. You can then move on to the Apply 2 phase. This allows you to make an unlimited number of applications, once at a time. If you’re unsuccessful or choose not to accept an offer, you can keep applying until you accept an offer, or when the application cycle for the academic year closes.

When you’re ready to submit your application, you’ll need to pay a one-off nominal fee of £1.

Application sections
--------------------

### 1\. Personal details

Some of these fields will already be populated from when you registered with UCAS Teacher Training. There’ll be some extra fields to confirm, such as your address, email, nationality and disability. 

### 2\. Choices

You can apply to at least three teacher training course providers – use all three for a greater chance of success. You should use the [Department for Education's search tool](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses-in-england) to determine the correct codes for your training providers and the subject you want to teach. You'll need:

*   Training provider code 
*   Training programme code

Once you know the codes for each provider, you'll need to include these in the choices section of the application form. The last fields in this section require you to declare any criminal convictions and provide any dates when you may not be available for interviews.

### 3\. Education

You’ll have the opportunity to add the schools, colleges and universities you attended and any qualifications gained – they’ll be split into four parts;

*   Schools/colleges/universities attended
*   Confirmation of your GCSE qualifications
*   A level results
*   Degree type and qualifications and credits from your degree

When completing your application, you’ll need to have your certificates – or details of your certificates - with you, as you'll need to know pass dates and examining boards where appropriate. If you’re unable to identify your examining board, you could select ‘other’ until you have the relevant paperwork. If all or part of your qualifications were gained abroad, you might need a NARIC check to determine equivalency to the UK standard. If you’re yet to retake a GCSE, there’s a ‘pending’ option, or a check box if your provider accepts equivalency tests.

### 4\. School and work experience

Here, you’ll need to provide details of your school experience and work history, including dates, any periods spent abroad and your current occupation. This can include work placements and observations, as well as paid and unpaid work. The word count is limited to 500 characters per experience, so it might be helpful to opt for bullet points focusing on your main skills, tasks and responsibilities.

### 5\. Personal statement

This is your chance to ensure your application stands out. The word count is tight; you’ll have 4,000 characters over 46 lines, so ensure you show off your knowledge and skills in relation to teaching. Read our tips on preparing a [successful personal statement](/node/616).

### 6\. References

You’ll need to provide two references - contacting your referees and submitting the completed references will need to be done via UCAS. This can only be done once all the sections above are completed. A handy tip is to let them know in advance they've been chosen, as you can't submit your application for consideration until you receive both references.
