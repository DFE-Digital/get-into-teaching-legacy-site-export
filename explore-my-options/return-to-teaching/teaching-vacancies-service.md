Teaching Vacancies service
==========================

Once you’ve qualified, search Teaching Vacancies, the Department for Education’s free to use job listing service, to find your perfect teaching role. 

You can search by location, subject, job title and salary and set up job alerts so that you don’t miss out on any opportunities.

If you’re an overseas teacher contemplating a return to teaching in England, find out more about the support available on our [overseas qualified teachers page](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/overseas-applicants).
