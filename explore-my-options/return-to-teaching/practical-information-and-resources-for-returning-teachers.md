Practical information and resources for returning teachers
==========================================================

When you return to teaching, you bring invaluable experience with you. To make that process as easy as possible we’ve put together some information and resources you might find useful.

Get up-to-date with changes in schools
--------------------------------------

Depending on how long you’ve been away, you might want to:

*   review the latest [Teachers’ Standards ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards "Read through the latest Teachers' Standards")
*   catch up on any changes to the [national curriculum and qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/schools-colleges-childrens-services/curriculum-qualifications "Review the national curriculum")
*   read through current behaviour management guidelines – see the Department for Education’s [advice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-behaviour-in-schools-checklist-for-teachers "Read Charlie Taylor's behaviour checklist") and [factsheet (PDF, 93KB)](/sites/default/files/behaviour_management_factsheet.pdf "Read through the DfE's behaviour management factsheet")

If you’ve been out of the profession for a while and are concerned about your ICT skills, you can test your ICT knowledge by completing an [ICT skills audit (PDF, 158KB)](/sites/default/files/ICT_skills_audit_returners.pdf "Test your ICT knowledge with this skills audit"). You can also find out more about ICT use in the classroom via:

*   the [Association for Information Technology in Initial Teacher Training website](http://www.itte.org.uk/ "Visit the Association for Information Technology in Initial Teacher Training website")
*   [learndirect](http://www.learndirect.com/ "Find out more about learndirect courses"), which offers a range of courses to help you update your basic ICT skills
*   your nearest City Learning Centre; these centres often offer a wide range of ICT CPD for teachers and education professionals – [check your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-council "Use this website to find your local council") for more details

It may also be worth looking into the [different types of schools](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/overview "Find out more about the different types of schools available") and staff roles to see what opportunities are available to you when it comes to progressing your career.

Returning physics teachers 
---------------------------

The [Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org/education/teach/information-for-returning-teachers/page_65260.html "Find out about returning to teaching physics") has a wealth of resources available that are perfect for supporting your return to the classroom. These cover a wide range of topics, including helpful tips on how to approach teaching [11–16 year olds](http://www.iop.org/education/teacher/support/spt/page_41531.html "Get access to helpful resources for teaching physics to 11-16 year olds"). You can also [visit the Nuffield Foundation](http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-physics "Visit the Nuffield Foundation for demonstrations of experiments") for demonstrations of experiments for pupils up to the age of 19.

If you’d like more information on what it’s like to teach physics today, you can also talk to other physics teachers at [TalkPhysics](http://www.talkphysics.org/ "Talk to other physics teachers at TalkPhysics"), or follow them on Twitter via [@TakeOnPhysics](https://twitter.com/takeonphysics "Follow TakeOnPhysics").

Returning mathematics teachers
------------------------------

Join the National Centre for the Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) to [access a wide range of teaching resources](https://www.ncetm.org.uk/ncetm/benefits-of-registering "Visit the National Centre for the Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics website"). There’s also a [self-evaluation tool](https://www.ncetm.org.uk/self-evaluation/ "Check your understanding of maths with this self-evaluation tool") to check your understanding of the maths you will be teaching, and to explore ideas on how you can develop your practice.

Career coaching for women returning to teaching
