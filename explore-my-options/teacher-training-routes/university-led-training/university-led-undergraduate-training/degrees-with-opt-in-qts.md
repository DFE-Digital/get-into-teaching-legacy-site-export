Degrees with opt-in QTS
=======================

This new undergraduate route allows students on select courses to incorporate teacher training partway through their degree course. Successful students will graduate with both a degree in their subject and the recommendation for qualified teacher status (QTS). There is plenty of financial support available, including student loans and bursaries of £9,000 in certain subjects – [find out more](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/university-led-training/university-led-undergraduate-training/funding-for-undergraduate-teacher-training).

### There are three types of degrees with opt-in QTS, all of which focus on secondary school teaching:

*   Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees
*   Integrated Masters (MA)

To apply for teacher training through this route, you will first need to be accepted onto an undergraduate degree course, which offers this option. Once on the course, the provider will guide you through the process to incorporate teacher training into your course. Degrees with opt-in QTS allow you to experience classroom teaching before you apply to integrate it into your degree. Your original course length will remain the same as your school placements will be incorporated within the length of your degree course.

If you are interested in training on an opt-in QTS course, we recommend contacting the universities directly before applying. 

Applications work in the same way as other undergraduate degree courses by applying through [UCAS](https://www.ucas.com/ucas/undergraduate/register "Go to UCAS ").
