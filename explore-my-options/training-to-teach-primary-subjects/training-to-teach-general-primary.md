What you need to know 
----------------------

Primary teachers often teach different subjects to the same class, so your training will also equip you with the skills you need to respond to your pupils’ individual needs. As a result, you’ll discover how to fulfil an increasingly pastoral role in the classroom, helping children feel at ease and settled into school life.

Once you qualify, you’ll start on a salary of at least £25,714, or £32,157 in inner London. As your career progresses, so will your salary – more information on teachers' pay ranges can be found on the [teachers' salary page](http://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teachers-salary-and-teaching-benefits/teachers-pay-scale-salary).

Additionally, teaching offers access to a wealth of other benefits – from a generous pension to enjoying the flexibility of school holidays, up to 13 weeks, which are unique to the profession.
