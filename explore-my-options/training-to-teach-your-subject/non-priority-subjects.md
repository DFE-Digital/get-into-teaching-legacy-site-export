Training to teach secondary subjects
====================================

As a teacher, you can make your skills and knowledge really count, and inspire young minds with your enthusiasm and passion in teaching your preferred subject. You can use this section to find out more about the different subjects you can teach.

### Priority subjects

As a result, you’ll find there is lots of support available to help you get into the classroom, from tax-free bursaries or scholarships to [extra support](https://register.getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/register) during the application process. 

If you don’t have a relevant degree or need to refresh your knowledge you could complete a fully funded [subject knowledge enhancement course (SKE)](/node/2339 "Find out more about SKE courses") before starting your training. 

If you’re not a graduate, there are a number of [options available for you to become a qualified teacher](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/university-led-training/university-led-undergraduate-training).
