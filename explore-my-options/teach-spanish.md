### Why teach languages?

What to expect   
-----------------

Your teacher training will help you discover how to open young people’s eyes and ears to the beauty of the language by exploring its uses in business, everyday life and culture. You’ll get to break down barriers and find ways to help both struggling and high-achieving students get the most from the language, nurturing their speaking and writing skills. Some of your pupils could progress from being complete beginners to using their language skills in their further education, travels or career. 

Once you qualify, you’ll start on a salary of at least £25,714, or £32,157 in inner London. As your career progresses, so will your salary – more information on teachers' pay ranges can be found on the [teachers' salary page](http://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teachers-salary-and-teaching-benefits/teachers-pay-scale-salary).
