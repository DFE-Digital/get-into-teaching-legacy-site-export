Career progression
==================

Teacher training will set you up to succeed from the very beginning. The variety of opportunities available means you’re always learning as a teacher and adding to your range of professional skills. You’ll develop the talents to succeed in your career, and realise many professional and personal ambitions.

Early Career Framework reforms
------------------------------

As part of the Department’s Recruitment and Retention Strategy in 2019, the DfE published the Early Career Framework (ECF). This sets out what you should learn about and learn how to do early in your career, to help you thrive in your first few years. From September 2021, all early career teachers undergoing statutory induction are entitled to a two-year training and support programme underpinned by the ECF as part of the ECF reforms.

This funded, two-year package of structured training and support away from the classroom, which includes a dedicated mentor, is designed to help you feel more confident and in control at the start of your career in teaching.

An early roll-out of the ECF reforms began in autumn 2020 in the North East, Doncaster, Bradford and Greater Manchester and the Department has ensured that all schools and early career teachers already have access to [high quality development materials](https://www.early-career-framework.education.gov.uk/) based on the ECF.

We are using this early roll-out phase to develop the programme ahead of national roll-out from September 2021. While the programme will last for two years, formal induction will still continue to last for one year for early roll-out.

You can find out more about [the framework here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-early-career-teachers/rollout-of-early-career-framework-support-package).

From Initial Teacher Training through to school leadership, we want to ensure  teacher and leader development is rooted in the best available evidence. The ECF reforms will build upon the evidence base and expert advice already established in the new Core Content Framework for Initial Teacher Training. In 2021 we will introduce a reformed suite of National Professional Qualifications to ensure teachers and leaders continue to have access to the best possible professional development opportunities throughout their careers.

Leadership
----------

Being a leader in a school could encompass a number of different roles, from taking charge of a year group or a particular key stage, all the way up to becoming a deputy or headteacher. In these areas you’ll have a large influence in the school, setting high standards and ensuring continuous improvement throughout the school.

There are also schemes such as the [Future Leaders accelerated leadership programme](http://www.future-leaders.org.uk/ "Learn more about the Future Leaders accelerated leadership programme."), which offers opportunities to qualified teachers who are ready to lead challenging secondary schools and tackle educational disadvantage.

Focus on your subject
---------------------

If you’re passionate about your subject area, you can pursue a career as a head of department or even as a leading practitioner. In these positions you’ll still have time in the classroom, but enjoy additional responsibilities – from training new teachers to acting as a leading authority on your subject within the school.

Pastoral care
-------------

If you’re particularly interested in ensuring the welfare of students throughout their education, a pastoral role might be for you. This can range from guiding a tutor group through school to becoming a head of year. You could also take on the role of a mentor for young people with special educational needs.

A salary to match your talent
-----------------------------

The pay rises generally happen quickly too – and recent reforms mean that schools now have more freedom over how to pay their teachers. This means that your salary will be linked more closely to performance, so you can get out what you put in and access greater rewards even earlier in your career – [find out more about teachers’ salaries](/node/2315 "View the different teacher salary ranges").
