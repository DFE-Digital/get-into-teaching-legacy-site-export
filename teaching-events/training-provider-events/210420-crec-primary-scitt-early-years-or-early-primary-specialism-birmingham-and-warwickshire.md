Event information:
------------------

We offer a one-year full-time school-based route to becoming a qualified primary teacher with a specialism in early years or early primary (3-7 years old). Our core aim is to help you become a confident, knowledgeable and highly employable teacher with a passion for working with young children to give them the best starting point in life, whatever their circumstances.

Our high-quality mentors and tutors have extensive practical experience and will help you succeed by offering consistent guidance and personalised support throughout the course. We are based at a centre of outstanding early years integrated practice, St Thomas Nursery School and Children's Centre in central Birmingham. All placements are set at a diverse range of schools across the West Midlands (Birmingham, Solihull, Warwickshire Teaching School Alliances).

Alongside the Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), this course also carries postgraduate accreditation (PGCE) awarded by Birmingham City University. Book a place on this virtual evening information event to learn more about our SCITT and have all your questions answered.
