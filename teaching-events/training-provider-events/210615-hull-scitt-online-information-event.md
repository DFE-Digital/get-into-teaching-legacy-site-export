Event information:
------------------

Our Online Information Events are a way for you to find out about the Hull SCITT courses, trainers and training network and for you to find out exactly what we're looking for in a Trainee. You will meet the Hull SCITT team and have the the opportunity to ask for advice or ask any questions you have about the application process or training. These events form an important part of the application process and will help you gain a better understanding of what is required, giving you a better chance when submitting your application.

Those who have attended our Online Information Events in the past have found the application process much easier, as you know what to expect and you know what we expect from you.
