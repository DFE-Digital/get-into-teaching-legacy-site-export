Event information:

If you are based in or around Leicester, Leicestershire, Rutland and have ever considered becoming a teacher or would like to find out more about what we offer at Inspiring Leaders and the benefits of a SCITT route into teaching, why not come along and be inspired with helpful, friendly, and informative advice. We can answer any questions you may have and offer useful tips on how to prepare for applications, interview, and training - especially during lockdown!

As a teacher training provider, ILTT offer a school-centred training route into teaching through our status as a SCITT. This hands-on route into teaching provides all trainees with a blend of school experience, alongside an innovative and inspiring taught programme which leads to the qualifications of QTS and a PGCE. Please note that we accept graduates who have achieved a 2:2 in any BA Honours Degree subject and have GCSEs at grade C or above in English, Maths, and Science.
