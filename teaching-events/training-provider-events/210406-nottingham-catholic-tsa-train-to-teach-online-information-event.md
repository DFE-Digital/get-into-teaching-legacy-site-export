Event information:
------------------

Join us on Zoom at this informative and friendly, event to give you an insight into the School Direct Programme and why school based Teacher Training is a great option to consider if you are thinking of teaching as a career.

Why School Direct?  
  
By basing your training in a school, you are able to learn from serving practitioners in a classroom context, applying your learning from the first day of your training. Each programme will differ slightly in its overall approach, but in general you can expect to be supported by outstanding practitioners, sharing best practice in teaching and learning. A mentor in school and a dedicated team from our University partners will also support you throughout your training.

Who should attend our event?  
  
Whether you are just about to graduate from your current course of study or are in work and considering a change in career, come along to one of our events and see if teaching is the career for you.

What to expect at our event  
  
It will be friendly and informal online with staff on hand to offer helpful advice about applying to the programme, give an insight into the training programme and the various sources of funding that are available. You will be able to meet current School Direct trainees to hear about their experience and fully understand why School Direct is such a great option if you are serious about a successful career in Education.
