Do you want to inspire young people and make a real difference? Are you passionate and enthusiastic about education? Do you want to be supported and have real opportunities to develop your career by an Ofsted 'Outstanding' Training Provider (November 2018).

The Portsmouth Teaching School Alliance provides a dynamic and supportive environment in which to train to teach. We offer a high quality school based training programme tailored to your needs. Trainees benefit from working alongside experienced and committed staff who are eager to share their skills, experience and practice. On successful completion of our course you will achieve a PGCE with QTS (with the option of 60 Masters Credits). Our lead school has been judged an 'Outstanding' school on three successive Ofsted inspections which is why our trainee teachers thrive and make excellent progress.

The Portsmouth Teaching School Alliance is committed to the continued professional development of its staff. Once qualified, we offer a highly structured induction and development programme to support you in your career progression. Within a caring and stimulating atmosphere we encourage our trainees to become outstanding teachers and future leaders. We are proud of our 100% pass rate and that our trainees go on to work as newly qualified teachers. A high percentage choose to work in local schools.
