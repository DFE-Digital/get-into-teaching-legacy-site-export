Event information:

Teaching takes you back to where it all started. It allows you to use your physics knowledge every day to communicate the subject in a thought-provoking and inspiring way, and is crucial in shaping the next generation of physicists and engineers.

Our free webinar will give you an insight into how to start your career in physics teaching while answering any questions you may have. There'll be further information on IOP Teacher Training Scholarship which offers scholars £26,000 tax-free funding plus:

access to a network of experienced physics teachers in their training region, with the opportunity to interact virtually with their scholar peers  
  
free IOP membership for their training year  
  
participation in online CPD events designed to help scholars develop additional physics teaching skills  
  
signposting to a wide range of IOP resources including IOPSpark & TalkPhysics.

We'll also be joined by a Teacher Training Advisor and provide further information on the different routes into teaching.
