Are you based in the East of England and considering a change of career that will allow you to inspire future generations within the classroom and beyond? Find out more about changing career to teach Computing, Maths, MFL or Science.

Teach First is an education charity which supports great teachers and brilliant leaders to ensure all children receive the best education, not just some. Our Training Programme is the largest teacher training and leadership programme in the country, and it comes with a whole host of benefits:

*   earn a salary throughout your training
*   gain a fully-funded Postgraduate Diploma in Education and Leadership (PGDE) and pay no fees.
*   receive close, expert support from your school and from us.
*   work in schools where you can make the biggest difference to your students' lives.

If you're eligible to teach Computing, Maths, MFL or Science, you're in demand! Why? There's simply not enough teachers of these subjects already - and pupil numbers in secondary schools are expected to be 15% higher by 2025. And this just means more opportunity for you to progress in your career, with our support.

These calls are specifically for people who graduated at least a year ago. You will be speaking to John Bidder, who is the dedicated recruiter for your area, so if you have any immediate questions, or if you can't make any of the available slots, don't hesitate to reach out on [our email](mailto:jbidder@teachfirst.org.uk.).Â
