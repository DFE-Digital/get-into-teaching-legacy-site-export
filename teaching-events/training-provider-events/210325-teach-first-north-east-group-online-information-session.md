Event information:

Switching to a career in teaching takes guts, but we're here to help. If you train to teach with Teach First, you'll get expert support every step of the way and earn a competitive salary from day one in the classroom. But you'll also have the chance to change countless lives, starting with your own.

If you'd like to find out more, come along to a group information session on 25th March where together with some fellow career changers in your region you will learn more about:

*   our training programme – salary, qualifications, Summer Institute and application process
*   eligibility requirements and subject availability – positions are currently open for Science, Maths, Computing and Modern Foreign Languages
*   training with us in the North East– we'll talk about main teaching hubs and potential employment locations in the Yorkshire and the Humber
*   transitioning into a new career – the session will be run by a Teach First representative who exclusively works with professionals and career changers and will tell you more about the support we offer before, during and after our training.

Please sign up by clicking the link and we will send you detailed instructions on how to join the session the day before the event.
