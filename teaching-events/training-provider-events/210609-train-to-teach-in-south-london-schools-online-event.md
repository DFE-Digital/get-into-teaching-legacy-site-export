Event information:

Find out more about our school based primary and secondary teacher training placements in our partnership of Lambeth, Croydon and Wandsworth primary and secondary schools. Our primary schools include Dunraven, Van Gogh, Goldfinch, St Andrew's Catholic, Corpus Christi, Rosendale, Sunnyhill and Julian's. Our secondary schools include Dunraven, St Mary's Catholic High School and The Elm Green School.

We have a long and successful track record in school based teacher training, giving our trainees the opportunity to be immersed in school life with the right balance of challenge and support, and enabling them not just to survive, but also to thrive as developing professionals. All our trainees have gone on to successful employment and a number are now middle leaders in local schools.

At this online event we will give you information about the skills, characteristics and experience we are looking for in applicants, what the training programme involves, the kind of training experience we are offering, how to approach the application process and what to expect at interview. You will have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have.
