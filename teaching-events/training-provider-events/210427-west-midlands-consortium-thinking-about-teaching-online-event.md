West Midlands Consortium - thinking about teaching online event

Event information:
------------------

We will be holding an informal 'virtual' Zoom session for potential applicants to teacher training who would like to learn more about the different routes into the profession. This is an opportunity to meet the Director of ITT together with course leaders and to ask any questions that you might have about teacher training. West Midlands Consortium is based at Thomas Telford School and exists within a partnership of over 70 schools, both primary and secondary, throughout the West Midlands and beyond. We offer a number of courses - PGCE, School Direct, and the Assessment-Only Route into teaching. The virtual session will enable you to feel better prepared to apply to begin your training together with opportunities to organise school experience and to hear more details about what our programmes offer to potential applicants.
