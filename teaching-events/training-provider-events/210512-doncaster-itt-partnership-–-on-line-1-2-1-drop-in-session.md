Event information:
------------------

Attend an on-line 1-2-1 drop-in session to find out which training programme is right for YOU, how and when to apply, which schools in Doncaster are involved and how YOUR training programme will be tailored to meet YOUR learning needs.

As Doncaster's ONLY accredited ITT Provider we'll also help YOU with information about making an application, YOUR qualifications, tuition fees, bursary grants and additional financial support that YOU may be eligible for. Or YOU may even be able to get paid a salary whilst training!

For nearly 18 years the Doncaster ITT Partnership has worked closely with schools, academies, the Council and now also with the University of Hull, to train hundreds of teachers for Doncaster's schools. Many former trainees are now in senior posts in our schools and helping to train the next generation of teachers... YOU!
