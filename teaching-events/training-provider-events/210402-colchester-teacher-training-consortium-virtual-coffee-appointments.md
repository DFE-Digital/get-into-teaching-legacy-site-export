Event information:

We are hosting virtual coffee appointments to give you the opportunity to have your questions answered. Once your appointment has been scheduled, you will be sent a zoom link for a free, one-to-one session with a member of our team. A member of our team will be able to provide you with information about the application and interview process, and the structure of the course. They will also help you to check your eligibility for our courses.

We are hosting these appointments on Fridays every week but if you are unable to attend on this day, we would be very happy to arrange an appointment for another day for you.
