Broadstone First School - get into teaching online information session
======================================================================

29 March 2021 at 19:30 - 20:30 in Online at the Online

Event information:
------------------

A relaxed and informal information session where anyone who has a possible interest in teaching can join us online and speak to the Poole Teaching School Alliance about the different routes that we offer. We will be able to provide you details about our inspirational and successful School Direct programme. Our vision is to develop and prepare the teachers of tomorrow with the skills and knowledge they need to deliver creative and challenging teaching and learning in the Primary setting.

Our inspirational programme is delivered by expert teachers using classroom settings and is enhanced by the facilities of the Learning Institute. Centre based training provides the opportunity to learn in a range of schools alongside other School Direct trainees. The majority of your training will be within the school setting.

We offer training in the age ranges 3-7 years and 5-11 years. Your base teaching placement will take place in one of our partnership schools and you will be released to access further training during the term time. A second placement will take place in a contrasting setting in a local school focusing on a different age range. Our School Direct Programme also offers opportunity to specialise in the Early Years age range.

Students are provided with the opportunity to qualify with a PCGE with QTS. Masters credits can also be gained during your training. We have been running this successful programme for six years and would love to tell you more about it.
