If you want to train as a primary or secondary teacher, you can find out more below. There's even the opportunity to build or refresh your knowledge before you start your teacher training if you have an unrelated degree, but studied the subject to A level or have plenty of professional experience with a fully funded subject knowledge enhancement course. You can find out more about teaching pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND) on our [training to teach pupils with SEND page](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/training-to-teach-pupils-with-send).
