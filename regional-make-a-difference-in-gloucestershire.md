Francesca's story

"I had such an enjoyable experience throughout my school life that I wanted to be able to actively play a part in allowing students to get the same joy out of learning. Plus, teenagers are absolutely hilarious and I am definitely learning a lot from them too! I can’t quite explain just how special it is to know that even in the smallest of ways, you are changing lives for the better."
