Arranging your references
=========================

Choosing your referees
----------------------

You'll need to supply contact details for 2 referees with your application form. This is a compulsory part of the application process and you will not be able to submit your application without them. 

**Choose referees who’ll endorse your:**

*   teaching passion and potential
*   suitability to work with children
*   academic abilities
*   reliability and professionalism

**Suitable referees include:**

*   your current line manager at work
*   previous employers
*   a teacher at a school where you work or volunteer
*   your university tutor or supervisor
*   a supplier or client you’ve worked with (if you’re self-employed)

Referees should not be family members, partners or friends. Training providers will only accept character references if there’s also an academic or professional reference. 

If you're applying for a School Direct (salaried) course, one of your references must be from an employer.

If you're struggling to find suitable referees, you can:

*   contact one of your chosen training providers for advice
*   [register with us](https://register.getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/register) for support with your teacher training application
