Anthony's story

![](/sites/default/files/Anthony%20Smith%20better%20image.jpg)**Antony, science teacher**  
  
"I love science and I wanted to share my enthusiasm and work with children to encourage a love of STEM subjects. The joy of seeing children grasp new topics and skills is incredible and I’ve worked with lovely, brilliant and committed teachers and some amazing children. Do I regret leaving my job and training to teach?  Not even slightly."
