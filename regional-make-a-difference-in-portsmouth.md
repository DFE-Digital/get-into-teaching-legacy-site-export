Caroline's story

"I had a real passion for teaching at a young age but wasn’t sure if it was right for me. I then decided to go into marketing. Every day at work I thought I want to be a teacher but thought it was too late. After attending an information evening I found out that it wasn’t and I haven’t looked back since!"
