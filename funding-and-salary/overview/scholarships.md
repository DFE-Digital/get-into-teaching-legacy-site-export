Scholarships
============

If you’re passionate about your subject and have the potential to be an inspirational teacher you could apply for a scholarship to support your training. Scholarships are awarded to the most gifted trainees in chemistry, computing, maths and physics in partnership with highly regarded professional subject associations.

As well as financial support, as a scholar you’ll enjoy a range of prestigious benefits, including:

*   free membership from the professional subject associations awarding the scholarship    
*   access to resources and events to support you through your training
*   support to improve your teacher practice and subject knowledge
*   networking opportunities from a community of like-minded scholars   

Eligibility
-----------

Scholarships are awarded in place of a bursary. Each of the professional scholarship bodies sets its own eligibility criteria - find out more on the dedicated scholarship pages:

*   [chemistry](/node/2391): Royal Society of Chemistry
*   [computing](/node/2393): BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT
*   [maths:](/node/2392) Mathematics Teacher Training Scholarships 
*   [physics:](/node/2378) Institute of Physics scholarships

If you’re not successful in your application for a scholarship, and secured a place on a qualifying teacher training course in England, you’ll still receive the standard bursary – [find out more about bursaries](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-my-teacher-training/bursaries-and-scholarships-for-teacher-training "Find out about teacher training bursaries").
