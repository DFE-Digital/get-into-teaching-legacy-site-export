Funding for training to teach computing
=======================================

If you train to teach computing, you could be eligible for a tax-free training bursary or a prestigious scholarship. There are three types of funding available if you’re on a non-salaried teacher training course. Depending on your circumstances, you could receive all three. Alternatively, you could choose to earn a salary while you train.

1\. Tax-free bursaries or scholarships
--------------------------------------

### Bursaries

As a computing trainee, you could be eligible for a £24,000 bursary if you have a first, 2:1, 2:2, Master’s or PhD.

### Scholarships

If you have a 2:2 or above, you could be eligible for a tax-free scholarship of £26,000 from BCS, [The Chartered Institute for IT](/node/2393). If your application for a scholarship is unsuccessful, you'll still be eligible for a bursary.

2\. Tuition Fee Loan and Maintenance Loan
-----------------------------------------

With or without a bursary or scholarship, you can also access a [Tuition Fee Loan to cover your tuition fees and a Maintenance Loan for your living costs](/node/2410). The available loans are:

*   a Tuition Fee Loan of up to £9,250 to cover your fees
*   a Maintenance Loan of up to £12,010 to support your living costs

3\. Additional financial support
--------------------------------

If you have children or a disability, extra funding is available. For instance, you could get:

*   85% of childcare costs up to £174.22 a week (1 child) or up to £298.69 a week (2 or more children) [Childcare Grant](https://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant)
*   up to £1,766 per year [Parents’ Learning Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/parents-learning-allowance)
*   [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit)
*   [Disabled Students’ Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas)
*   up to £3,094 per year [Adult Dependants' Grant](https://www.gov.uk/adult-dependants-grant)
