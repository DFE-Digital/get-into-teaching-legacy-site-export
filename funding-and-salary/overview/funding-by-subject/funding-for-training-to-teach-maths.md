Funding for training to teach maths
===================================

If you’re successful in your application to train to teach maths, you could benefit from a tax-free bursary or a prestigious scholarship. There are three types of funding available if you’re on a non-salaried teacher training course. Depending on your circumstances, you could receive all three. Alternatively, you could choose to earn a salary while you train.

1\. Tax-free bursaries or scholarships
--------------------------------------

### Bursaries

With a first, 2:1, 2:2, Master’s or PhD, you could get a £24,000 tax-free bursary while you train as a teacher. 

### Scholarships

As an alternative to a bursary, if you have at least a 2:1, you could be awarded a scholarship from the [Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA)](/node/2392). You can still apply if you have a 2:2, but you’ll need to provide evidence of significant relevant experience.

If your application for a scholarship is successful, you'll be guaranteed £26,000 tax-free during your teacher training year.

If your scholarship application is unsuccessful, you will still be eligible for a bursary. Once you know if you’ll be receiving a bursary or scholarship, you can find out [how and when you will receive your tax-free funding](/node/2396 "Find out how you will be paid").

2\. Tuition Fee Loan and Maintenance Loan
-----------------------------------------

With or without a bursary or scholarship, you can also access a [Tuition Fee Loan to cover your tuition fees and a Maintenance Loan for your living costs](/node/2410). The available loans are:

*   a Tuition Fee Loan of up to £9,250 to cover your fees
*   a Maintenance Loan of up to £12,010 to support your living costs

3\. Additional financial support
--------------------------------

If you have children or a disability, extra funding is available. For instance, you could get:

*   85% of childcare costs up to £174.22 a week (1 child) or up to £298.69 a week (2 or more children) [Childcare Grant](https://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant)
*   up to £1,766 per year [Parents’ Learning Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/parents-learning-allowance)
*   [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit)
*   [Disabled Students’ Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas)
*   up to £3,094 per year [Adult Dependants' Grant](https://www.gov.uk/adult-dependants-grant)

Find out more information on the [extra financial support available](/node/6585). 

Earn a salary while you train
-----------------------------

Alternatively, you could earn a salary with [School Direct (salaried), Postgraduate Teaching Apprenticeships](/node/2388) or [Teach First](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/training-programme).
