Teaching Internships
====================

With Teaching Internships, you will be able to experience the teaching profession, gain new skills and be paid £300 per week for your time. So, if you are an undergraduate on a STEM related degree and are interested in teaching secondary maths or physics, then the Teaching Internship programme could be for you.

The programme takes place in schools across England. You will get the opportunity to experience a range of activities to help you get a feel for school life including: 

*   classroom experience, which could include: assisting with lessons and providing subject support to pupils
*   shadowing experienced teachers and observing lessons, followed by a chance to jointly plan and deliver lessons
*   one-to-one guidance from outstanding classroom teachers
*   opportunities to network with qualified subject specialists
